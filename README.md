# neural-networks
This repository presents a C language implementation for the creation and management of neural networks. Focusing on computational neuroscience, the Hodgking-Huxley and Izhikevich models are used to simulate neuron dynamics, allowing for in-depth studies of neural behavior and synaptic connectivity.
